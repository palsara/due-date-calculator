# The problem

We are looking for a solution that implements a due date calculator in an issuetracking
system. Your task is to implement the CalculateDueDate method:

- Input: Takes the submit date/time and turnaround time.
- Output: Returns the date/time when the issue is resolved.

# Rules

- Working hours are from 9AM to 5PM on every working day, Monday to Friday.
- Holidays should be ignored (e.g. A holiday on a Thursday is considered as a
  working day. A working Saturday counts as a non-working day.).
- The turnaround time is defined in working hours (e.g. 2 days equal 16 hours).
  If a problem was reported at 2:12PM on Tuesday and the turnaround time is
  16 hours, then it is due by 2:12PM on Thursday.
- A problem can only be reported during working hours. (e.g. All submit date
  values are set between 9AM to 5PM.)
- Do not use any third-party libraries for date/time calculations (e.g. Moment.js,
  Carbon, Joda, etc.) or hidden functionalities of the built-in methods.

# Additional info

- Use your favourite programming language.
- Do not implement the user interface or CLI.
- Do not write a pseudo code. Write a code that you would commit/push to a
  repository and which solves the given problem.
- You have 72 hours to submit your solution.
- You can submit your solution even if you have not finished it fully.

# Bonus – Not mandatory

- Including automated tests to your solution is a plus.
- Test-driven (TDD) solutions are especially welcome.
- Clean Code (by Robert. C. Martin) makes us happy.

# How to start, run tests

- yarn install
- yarn start
- yarn test
